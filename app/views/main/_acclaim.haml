    .quote "The ACT Boost also addresses why certain sections of the ACT test are difficult, and how to overcome those tricky sections. The Boostâ€™s structure is very easy to use. It is written to give strategies on each ACT section, so that if you are struggling on certain sections you can jump to the section you need help with and read the strategies" -C.G.
